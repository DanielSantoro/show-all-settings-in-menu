== Description ==

##Description##

This plugin adds an "All Settings" option in your **Settings** administration panel, as shown [in the screenshots tab](http://wordpress.org/plugins/show-all-settings-in-menu/screenshots/).

This same panel can be reached by navigating to `[yoururl.com]/wp-admin/options.php`. 


= Notes =

This plugin was created and tested using WordPress 3.9.1. No guarantee provided - please use the All Settings panel with caution. If you experience any issues, please [let the developer know](http://danielsantoro.com/contact/). You should only install this plugin if you\'re confident in your abilities with `options.php`.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin & install it to your `wp-content/plugins` folder (or use the Plugins menu through the WordPress Administration section)
2. Activate the plugin
3. Navigate to **Settings > All Settings**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: Why? Why are you doing this!? =
A: Because developers could often have need for this panel. It's a very handy and very underused feature that I'm hoping to bring to the forefront.

= Q: Who would use this? =
A: Plugin or Theme developers who frequently need access to these settings, but don't want to crack open the database.

= Q: If I'm a regular user, do I need this plugin? =
A: Probably not - because it contains important settings, you run the risk of accidentally changing something that could cause problems. Only install this plugin if you also like to live dangerously.

= Q: Isn't this the same thing as just going to `[yoururl.com]/wp-admin/options.php`? =
A: Yep, pretty much! This just makes that feature more accessible. 

= Q: I was messing around with the settings page and now my site is broken!? =
A: Sorry about that, but there's not much I can do :( Install from a backup or look into changing the value back through mySQL. You should only install this plugin if you're confident in your abilities with `options.php`.
