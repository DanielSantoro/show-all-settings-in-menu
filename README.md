#Show All Settings in Menu#

A simple WordPress plugin that will add an "All Settings" option in the WordPress menu for easy access to `options.php`.

##Description##
This plugin adds an "All Settings" option in your **Settings** administration panel, [as shown in this screenshot](http://wordpress.org/plugins/show-all-settings-in-menu/screenshots/).
This same panel can be reached by navigating to `[yoururl.com]/wp-admin/options.php`. 

##Notes##
This plugin was created and tested using WordPress 3.9.1. No guarantee provided - please use the All Settings panel with caution. If you experience any issues, please [let the developer know](http://danielsantoro.com/contact/). You should only install this plugin if you\'re confident in your abilities with `options.php`.

## Installation ##
1. Download the plugin & install it to your `wp-content/plugins` folder (or use the Plugins menu through the WordPress Administration section)
2. Activate the plugin
3. Navigate to **Settings > All Settings**

## Frequently Asked Questions ##
**Q:** Why? Why are you doing this!?  
**A:** Because developers could often have need for this panel. It's a very handy and very underused feature that I'm hoping to bring to the forefront.

**Q:** Who would use this?  
**A:** Plugin or Theme developers who frequently need access to these settings, but don't want to crack open the database

**Q:** If I'm a regular user, do I need this plugin?  
**A:** Probably not - because it contains important settings, you run the risk of accidentally changing something that could cause problems. Only install this plugin if you also like to live dangerously.

**Q:** Isn't this the same thing as just going to `[yoururl.com]/wp-admin/options.php`?  
**A:** Yep, pretty much! This just makes that feature more accessible.

**Q:** I was messing around with the settings page and now my site is broken!?  
**A:** Sorry about that, but there's not much I can do :( Install from a backup or look into changing the value back through mySQL. You should only install this plugin if you're confident in your abilities with `options.php`.
